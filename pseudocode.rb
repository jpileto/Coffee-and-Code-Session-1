for num in 1..100
  if num % 2 == 0
    puts "even"
  else
    puts "odd"
  end
end


# Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
#
# For the multiples of 3 print "Bitmaker" instead of the number.
# For the multiples of 5 print "HQ" instead of the number.
# For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print "BitmakerHQ"

# For the problem above here are my steps to arrive to a solution:
# a. use the for loop so I can loop all the numbers from 1 through 100
# b. formulate an if/else statement to check on the 3 conditions listed above
# and print the correct return value for each number being evaluated.
